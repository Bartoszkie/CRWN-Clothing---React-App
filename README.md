### React e-commerce 
So, this is my biggest react project (yet) and I'm still developing it while learning from all kinds of tutorials/documentations. 

### What is this about
Quick intro: this app is about online clothes shopping. Users have ability to log-in - using their newly created account -  
or log-in via Google accounts. Authentication is handled by Firebase.  
State managment is managed by Redux - loggers still appears in console beacuse project is still in develop fase.  
Users also have ability to choose items they want, get a quick reviev about what is in their cart at the particular moment  
and 'go to checkout' to see what total cost is, what quantity of particular products is and decide to delete item or not.
